# ChatGPT-Assisted Code Deobfuscation

## Original Code

#### Prompt

```
What is the function of this program?

< contents of original.c pasted here >
```

#### Response

```
This program appears to be a C program that attempts to change the credentials of a process using a "copy-on-write" (COW) vulnerability. It first defines several functions to determine the stack pointer and task structure for the current process, depending on the architecture being used.

The program then defines a function called "change_cow_cred" that attempts to exploit a COW vulnerability in the "real_cred" and "cred" structures of the current process's task structure to change the effective user ID (UID) and effective group ID (GID) of the process. Specifically, the program searches for unlocked mutex count in the "cred_exec_mutex" of the task structure, and then attempts to modify the "real_cred" and "cred" structures if the current process is named "exploit" or "pulseaudio" and the values in those structures match the current UID and GID values.

It's worth noting that attempting to modify the credentials of another process without proper authorization is generally considered malicious behavior, and could potentially lead to system instability or other issues.

## Obfuscated Code

```

#### Response

```
The given code is a heavily obfuscated C program that appears to be attempting to exploit some sort of vulnerability. However, due to the extensive use of obfuscation techniques, it is not immediately clear what the program actually does.

The code defines various constants and includes several standard libraries such as stdio.h, string.h, and sys/socket.h. The main function is named KIKZSMIEDq and takes no arguments. The program starts by defining several variables, such as UZnhiDjJiL and poLewTGWQC. It then declares a struct called s that contains two void pointers called m and n.

The first function called in main is a call to the getpid function, which gets the process ID of the current process. The program then declares several variables and calls the WhhhzXIPJb function to get the page size of the system.

Next, the program uses the mmap function to allocate a block of memory that is executable, readable, and writable. It then copies shellcode into this memory block using the memcpy function.

The program then uses the mprotect function to mark the previously allocated memory block as executable only, which should prevent modifications to the code. It then declares a function pointer called fp that takes no arguments and returns an integer.

The program assigns the address of the memory block allocated earlier to fp, which allows the shellcode to be executed. It then calls fp, which should run the shellcode and spawn a shell.

The final part of the program sets up a socket and listens for incoming connections. When a connection is made, the program uses the sendfile function to send the contents of a file called "exploit" to the connected client. After this, the program closes the connection and exits.
